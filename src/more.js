        Strolls is a multimedia exploration of urban identity, memory, and the
        dynamic rhythms that define city life. As citizens, most of us spend our
        lives immersed in the urban environment—an ecosystem that shapes and
        reflects our identities. Understanding the city is not just about
        navigating its streets; it's about recognising the profound influence it
        has on who we are.
        <br />
        Cities, with their intricate networks and ceaseless activity, have often
        been compared to machines, organisms, and even battlegrounds throughout
        history. During the industrial revolution, cities were seen as
        machines—powerful, efficient, and relentless, much like the technology
        that was reshaping them. But today, as we deepen our understanding of
        both the natural world and the complexities of urban life, the metaphor
        of the city as a living, breathing organism resonates more strongly.
        <br />
        Cities, like organisms, grow, adapt, and evolve. They consume resources,
        produce waste, and distribute energy through their streets and
        infrastructure, much like veins in a circulatory system. But beyond this
        systematic comparison, there’s a philosophical dimension to urban life:
        the question of consciousness. Alan Watts suggested that consciousness
        exists in varying degrees across nature, and Strolls extends this idea
        to the city itself. Can a city, shaped by generations of human life,
        possess its own form of awareness?
        <br />
        In Strolls, the city is not just a backdrop—it’s a living entity,
        pulsating with energy and memory. The project invites viewers to
        experience this through immersive, stitched panoramas that capture the
        city’s essence, from bustling streets to underground passages. The
        soundscapes, crafted from real urban sounds, interwoven with selected
        media audios and generated narratives. These auditory layers create a
        sensory fabric that mirrors the chaotic, yet rhythmic pulse of urban
        life.
        <br />
        Strolls is an exploration into what makes cities human—what shapes their
        memory, personality, and consciousness. It offers a chance to stroll
        through the streets of different cities, interact with their unique
        rhythms, and engage in a multi-sensory experience that challenges us to
        see the city not just as a place, but as a living, breathing presence.
